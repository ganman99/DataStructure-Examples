First Question:
A skip list is a probabilistic data structure. The skip list is used to store a sorted list of elements or data with a linked list. It allows the process of the elements or data to view efficiently. 
In one single step, it skips several elements of the entire list, which is why it is known as a skip list.The skip list is an extended version of the linked list. 
It allows the user to search, remove, and insert the element very quickly. It consists of a base list that includes a set of elements which maintains the link hierarchy of the subsequent elements.
Write  a  Java  program  that  builds  a  Skip  List  Data  Structure.  You  are  responsible  to implementing  add  node  and  search  key  methods.  
You  don’t  need  to  write  deleting method.Compare your efficiency with a normal single linked list.

Second Question:
Given two sorted lists L1 and L2, write a Java program to generate a third list which contains all nodes of L1 and L2 in sorted order. (i.e., the third list is sorted too). 
Same values in lists should be retrieved only once i.e., union set of lists should be created (You can assume that the lists contain only integer values).

Third Question:
Implement a Java application that place each word from textfile to a hash table.Find distinct word size and find most repeated word in a file.

Fourth Question:
Write a Java program that calculates a mathematical string received from the user.You must calculate your values either use tree or stack.
You can use both of them. It’s up to you. Hint: You can use infix posVix or prefix expressions.
